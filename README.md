# My Personal Website

Hi, my name is Isabell Ventouris. I am currently enrolled in a bootcamp where I am learning full-stack web development. This project marks the beginning of my journey as a developer, and Iâ€™m excited to create my first personal website.

This website will showcase my skills and personal background. It will consist of three main pages:

Home Page: A landing page introducing who I am and what this website is about.
About Me: A section that provides more insight into my journey, background, and the technologies I am learning in this bootcamp.
Portfolio: A showcase of some of the projects I have worked on, including my web development and software development work.
Thank you for visiting my personal website!
